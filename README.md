# Programming Psychology Experiments in Python

Welcome to the course "Programming Psychology Experiments in Python". This course gives an integrative overview
of programming psychology experiments using the programming language Python and the graphics library PyGame.
The course is structured as follows:

The first part introduces basic programming concepts of Python in the context of computerized psychology experiments.
The second part introduces the basics of PyGame and its use for programming experiments.
The last part introduces object oriented programming techniques.

Each chapter is accompanied by lab exercises (table at the bottom of this page).
These exercises allow students to practice the concepts described in each chapter in more depth.

Feedback and recommendations for improvement are always welcome.
