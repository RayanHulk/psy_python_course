    "In this lab you will create your first real graphical experiment, similar to the one we created in Chapter 9 (Stroop Experiment). In this lab, however, your task will be to complete a program to form a simplified Go-NoGo Task. That is, the task should look as follows:<br>\n",
    "- Get demographic input from the console.\n",
    "- Present instructions.\n",
    "- Present circles in RED or GREEN color in random alternation, each preceded by a fixation cross. Each circle should be presented either a maximum of 5 seconds if no response was made by the participant or until the participant responds.\n",
    "- The participant's task is to press the SPACE bar as fast as possible for green circles and withold the response for red circles (see text files with instructions).\n",
    "- Whenever a response was made, record it and save the reaction time. When no response was made, append \"na\" as the reaction time.\n",
    "- Make sure all results are logged correctly and saved to a directory named `data`.\n",
