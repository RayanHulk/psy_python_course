GREEN circles are considered GO-trials, as you are asked
to perform an action (e.g. pressing SPACE bar)

RED circles are considered STOP-trials, as you are asked
to withhold your response (e.g. not press SPACE bar)

Please try to respond as accurately and quickly as possible.
As we are also interested in how fast you respond
on the GO-trials, we will record your reaction time.
