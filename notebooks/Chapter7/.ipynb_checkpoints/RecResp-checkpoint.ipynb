    "## Handling Events\n",
    "In most psychology experiments we want to be able to handle specific events. For example, moving the mouse, pressing certain keys on the keyboard, or closing the program are all events that need to be processed by PyGame. In the context of psychology experiements, the two most important events are the **quit event** and **keyboard events**. The quit event enables exiting the program at any point if needed and keyboard events are necessary for collecting responses that we are interested in (e.g. response options in a reaction time task). The basic syntax of event handling in PyGame is as follows: <br>\n",
