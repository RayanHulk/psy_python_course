    "## Experiment Outline\n",
    "Before we start programming any psychological experiment, we need to know how the individual tasks and stages that we want to realize. In this first stage we are simply designing an experiment on the abstract level without writing an code. In psychology this stage is often part of the **reseach design** or **study design**.<br>\n",
    "Specifically, the goal of this stage is to clearly define the procedure of the experiment. So let's assume we want to program a simplified *Stroop Experiment* in which participants are presented with two color words (e.g. red, blue) in differing font colors (e.g. red, blue). So the font color can either match the meaning of the word or not. Participants are then asked to press one of two keys whenever the meaning of the word is **blue** another key whenever the meaning of the word is **red**. Thus, we want to find out if the *accuracy* and *latency* of responses differs when the meaning and color are congrunet in contrast to when they are incongruent. <br><br>The **experimental outline** of such an experiment could look like this:"
