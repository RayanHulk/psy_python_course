Inside the while-loop, the `welcomeInst` object is created using the `text_object()` function from the `TextPresenter` module and then this text object (pygame text surface to be more precise) is blitted to the screen. Finally we flip everything to the foreground and wait for a keypress. Specifically, we wait for the user to press the `RETURN` key.
