In the case of developping simple psychology experiments the OOP principles are mostly used to encapsulate code and give the entire implementation more structure, as the code base is rather small compared to more complex programs. So in the context of psychological experiments the functional non-OOP way of building programs is completely sufficient and OOP concepts can be used in addition, but do not have to be used.<br><br>\n",
