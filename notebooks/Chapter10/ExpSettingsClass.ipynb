    "# The Experiment Settings Class\n",

In doing so, we will use the simplified Stroop experiment that we programmed in chapter 9 and move all functionalities related to settings (e.g. settings dictionary, methods for loading from files, methods for getting and setting instructions text) into a separate **settings class**. Specifically we will cover the following topics:\n",
