    "In Python a file can be opened with the `open()` statement which takes two parameters `open(filename, 'mode')`. The first parameter is a string with the name of the file and the second specifies the mode in which the file should be opened. To read from an opend file, we can simply call a `read()` method on the opened file object. The following modes are available when opening a file:\n",
