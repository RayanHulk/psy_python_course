This is because we need to keep in mind that we are interacting with the computers graphics now, so even though it is just text that we are presenting, that text needs to be drawn to the screen in the same way that the background or some shapes are drawn to the screen.<br><br>\n",

    "## Rendering and Blitting Text\n",
    "**1)** First, we will learn how to create the rectangle object that can hold our text. In PyGame this can be done like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a font object\n",
    "# parameters are 'system font type' and 'size'\n",
    "font = pygame.font.SysFont(\"Arial\", 40)\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a text string, text color, background color, and a rendered text object\n",
    "# params of the render method are 'text', anti-aliasing, color and background color\n",
    "text = \"Hello\"\n",
    "textColor = (0, 0, 0) # text is black\n",
    "bgColor = (160, 160, 160) # bgColor will be light grey\n",
    "textItem = font.render(text, True, textColor, bgColor)\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Let's go through the above code step by step. First we create a variable that represents our text named `text`. From earlier sections you should know that this variable is a *string*. Then, we are specifying the color of the text and the bgColor:<br><br>\n",
    "`textColor = (0, 0, 0) # text is black`<br>\n",
    "`bgColor = (160, 160, 160) # bgColor will be light grey`<br><br>\n",
    "Now we have all basic paramters that we need to create the text rectangle. We do this by creating a font instance and rendering the text which we save in the variable `textItem`. The creation of the font instance is done in the first line in the above code example:<br><br>\n",
    "`font = pygame.font.SysFont(\"Arial\", 40)`<br><br>\n",
    "Then, we render the text and thus create our text rectangle object:<br><br>\n",
    "`textItem = font.render(text, True, textColor, bgColor)`<br><br>\n",
    "The parameters that we pass to the `render()` function are **text**, **anti-aliasing (makes smoth edges)**, **the text color**, and **the background color**.\n"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**2)** Now that we have created our text rectangle, we can render it to the backbuffer using the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# specify positions\n",
    "position = (150, 200)\n",
    "\n",
    "# change color of screen and draw everything\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Let's go through this code snippet again. In order to render our text, we need to have a position. Thus, in the first line we are defining that position as a tuple of coordinates on the screen. So the tuple `(0, 0)` would be the **upper left corner** and in our example, as the screen width and height will be `(400, 400)`, the text will be placed fairly at the center of the screen if we specify `position = (150, 200)`.<br><br>\n",
    "Before blitting everyhing the next line is filling the screen with a predefined background color:<br><br>\n",
    "`screen.fill(bgColor)`<br><br>\n",
    "And finally, we can render everything to the backbuffer using<br><br>\n",
