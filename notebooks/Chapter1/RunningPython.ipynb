We have already used the command line when installing python in the previous section, so you should already know how to start it on your operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Linux). The terminal commands that we will introduce in this section assume you are using Windows, but the commands are very similar on Mac OS and Linux as well (for a sample introduction on using the command line on these systems see [this website](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/)."
