    "As you can see the program encounters a condition. At this point code is executed repeatedly in a loop until that condition is no longer true anymore. Loops are a very powerful tool that enable you to reduce the amount of code you have to write. For example, recall that so far we had to print list items one by one using the `print()` statement each time we wanted to print an item of a list. As we will see, with loops such tasks can be handled way more efficiently."

    "In the context of psychology experiments, it is very common to iterate over lists. In order to do this, we need to use the python built-in functions `len()` and `range()`. The `len()` function gives us the total number of objects to iterate over and the `range()` function gives us the actual sequence to iterate over. Please note that the iterating index can be any string but we use a word that is meaningful to us in the context of the object we want iterate over. For example, if want to iterate over a list called `stimuli` it makes sense to name the iterator `stimulus`. Also note that we use list indexing within the indexing variable as to present each stimulus from the list. <br><br>\n",
